<!-- 
	In order for the Flash runtime to be able to upload files across domains, we
	need to uplaod this document to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket to which we 
	will be uploading files. 

	NOTE: Once uploaded, make sure that "Everyone" has Open/Download AND View 
	permissions on the file; otherwise, you'll get a security error. Also, if you 
	upload this file more than once, I have found that I need to RE-SAVE the 
	permissions on the object (even if they already say Open/Download/View).
